## CICD 

## What is CI 
- It is practice where developer frequently integrate their code changes into a shared repository , often multiple times a day.
- By integrating regularly, we can detect  errors quickly and improve the quality of software . Automated test run on each integration to ensure new code does'nt break the existing code base.

## What is CD
- CD is extenstion of CI part that automates the deployment of the code changes to production enviroment . This means every changes that pases that CI part is automatically deployed to the production enviroment .
- This ensure that the software can be released at any time, reducing the time to market and allowing for faster delivery of new features and bug fixes.


## What is Continuous Delivery 
- Continuous Delivery ensures that the software can be released to production at any time. This means  the software is kept in a deployable state throughout its lifecycle.
- it allows teams to release new features, improvemnts, and bug fixes more frequently .
